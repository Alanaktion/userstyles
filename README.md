# UserStyles
*A collection of my UserStyles, mostly dark themes. Typically high-quality.*

## Installation

Install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) for either [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/), then install any styles by clicking on them below. Once installed, the themes will update automatically, according to your Stylus settings.

If you prefer, most of these are also on [my userstyles.org profile](https://userstyles.org/users/299011), though they may not be up-to-date. I don't update there very often now that they're basically evil.

## Contributing

I'm more than welcome to pull request and issues, including feature requests. If you're reporting an issue with a current style, screenshots and URLs are helpful!

## Themes

### Laravel/Lumen Night

A clean, complete dark theme for Laravel and Lumen Docs, that also includes most of the landing pages.

### Floatplane Night

A complete dark theme for Floatplane. This includes all accessible pages for paid subscribers, but isn't intended to style the Floatplane creator CMS. Also included is an optional full-width player style.

ðŸ“¦ [floatplane-theater.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alanaktion/userstyles/master/styles/floatplane-theater.user.css) (hides left-nav and live chat)

### Patreon Night

This is a work-in-progress, but currently supports the home page, creator pages, and messages. Additional pages will be supported over time. Expect this style to break very often, since Patreon's DOM changes drastically every few weeks, and doesn't include many consistent IDs or classes.
